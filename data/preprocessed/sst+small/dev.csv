2,care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman 's destructive escapism or the grace in rebellion found by his characters .

2,it 's virtually impossible to like any of these despicable characters .
2,blue crush is as predictable as the tides .
2,an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we 've been watching for decades
2,with flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity undisputed is nearly incoherent an excuse to get to the closing bout ... by which time it 's impossible to care who wins .

2,my response to the film is best described as lukewarm .
2,a soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a minute commercial for nba properties .
2,i also believe that resident evil is not it .

2,i suspect that you 'll be as bored watching morvern callar as the characters are in it .
2,schneidermeister ... makin ' a fool of himself ... losin ' his fan base ...
2,this movie ... does n't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is .
2,fluffy and disposible .
2,the biggest problem i have other than the very sluggish pace is we never really see her esther blossom as an actress even though her talent is supposed to be growing .
2,it is a popcorn film not a must own or even a must see .
2,needed a little less bling bling and a lot more romance .
2,too close to phantom menace for comfort .
