2,a puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks .
2,impostor ca n't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels fight off various anonymous attackers and evade elaborate surveillance technologies .

2,serving sara should be served an eviction notice at every theater stuck with it .
2,the self serious equilibrium makes its point too well a movie like life is n't much fun without the highs and lows .
2,filled with low brow humor gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life .
2,given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster this time there is n't much .
2,her film is like a beautiful food entre that is n't heated properly so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless .
2,some studio pizazz might have helped .
2,ultimately sarah 's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness .
2,manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite .
2,too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century .

2,he 's not good with people .
2,the first hour is tedious though ford and neeson capably hold our interest but its just not a thrilling movie .
2,sadly as blood work proves that was a long long time ago .
2,the director mostly plays it straight turning leys ' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder .
2,the movie 's messages are quite admirable but the story is just too clichd and too often strains credulity .
2,this is very much of a mixed bag with enough negatives to outweigh the positives .
2,violent vulgar and forgettably entertaining .
2,it 's provocative stuff but the speculative effort is hampered by taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill considered notion that hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances .
2,warmed over tarantino by way of wannabe elmore leonard .
2,... the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well ... but quite frankly scoob and shag do n't eat enough during the film . '
2,trouble every day is a success in some sense but it 's hard to like a film so cold and dead .
2,sorry charlie
2,maybe leblanc thought hey the movie about the baseball playing monkey was worse . ''
2,the movie is a lumbering load of hokum but ... it 's at least watchable .
2,comes off more like a misdemeanor a flat unconvincing drama that never catches fire .
2,just a string of stale gags with no good inside dope and no particular bite .
2,an ultra low budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent .
2,louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected indie film mode and brother hoffman 's script stumbles over a late inning twist that just does n't make sense .
2,what starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points .
2,the title trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you 're watching this ultra manipulative thriller .
2,just because it really happened to you honey does n't mean that it 's interesting to anyone else .
2,a soggy cliche bound epic horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title .
2,overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
2,just not campy enough
2,the problem with the bread my sweet is that it 's far too sentimental .
2,an unsatisfying hybrid of blair witch and typical stalk and slash fare where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living .
2,a listless and desultory affair .
2,kwan makes the mix and match metaphors intriguing while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action .
2,director uwe boll and writer robert dean klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out can not overcome blah characters .

2,dragonfly ' is a movie about a bus wreck that turns into a film wreck .
2,lucy 's a dull girl that 's all .
2,the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome .
2,an uneven look into a grim future that does n't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on philip k. dick stories .
2,fincher takes no apparent joy in making movies and he gives none to the audience .
2,the movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable .
2,expect to be reminded of other better films especially seven which director william malone slavishly copies .
2,formula promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip .

2,attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy handed that they instead pummel the audience .
2,the problem with this film is that it 's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot .
2,devolves into the derivative leaning on badly rendered cgi effects .
2,... too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be .
2,they ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering .
2,very special effects brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality ca n't hide the giant achilles ' heel in stuart little there 's just no story folks .
2,though avary has done his best to make something out of ellis ' nothing novel in the end his rules is barely worth following .
2,a sequence of ridiculous shoot 'em up scenes .
2,billy crystal and robert de niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse .
2,contrasting the original ringu with the current americanized adaptation is akin to comparing the evil dead with evil dead ii
2,its plot and animation offer daytime tv serviceability but little more .
2,sure i hated myself in the morning .
2,resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project .
2,a mediocre exercise in target demographics unaware that it 's the butt of its own joke .
2,uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth .
2,enough similarities to gymkata and howie long 's firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long suffering eyeballs .
2,chokes on its own depiction of upper crust decorum .
2,human nature talks the talk but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal .
2,laggard drama wending its way to an uninspired philosophical epiphany .
2,not only does leblanc make one spectacularly ugly looking broad but he appears miserable throughout as he swaggers through his scenes .
2,but the cinematography is cloudy the picture making becalmed .
2,a hit and miss affair consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped .
2,if welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two he probably would n't be too crazy with his great grandson 's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way .
2,it has its moments of swaggering camaraderie but more often just feels generic derivative and done to death .
2,see clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with minutes .
2,it 's easy to love robin tunney she 's pretty and she can act but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices .
2,though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy handed metaphors to choke a horse or at least slow him down to a canter .
2,the result is solemn and horrifying yet strangely detached .
2,the problem it is with most of these things is the script .
2,determined to be fun and bouncy with energetic musicals the humor did n't quite engage this adult .
2,it should be interesting it should be poignant it turns out to be affected and boring .
2,everything is off .
2,as a revenge thriller the movie is serviceable but it does n't really deliver the delicious guilty pleasure of the better film versions .
2,nicks and steinberg match their own creations for pure venality that 's giving it the old college try .
2,undercover brother does n't go far enough .
2,but for the most part the weight of water comes off as a two way time switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness .
2,teen movies have really hit the skids .
2,the one not so small problem with expecting is that the entire exercise has no real point .
2,the problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one there 's no saving the movie .
2,... a strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense .
2,no even that 's too committed .
2,consider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director i admire .
2,there are weird resonances between actor and role here and they 're not exactly flattering .
2,what happened with pluto nash ?
2,the story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough .
2,watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good .
2,soderbergh tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience 's intelligence and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness .
2,little more than a frothy vanity project .
2,much anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie .
2,the story has some nice twists but the ending and some of the back story is a little tired .
2,as saccharine as it is disposable .
2,this story of unrequited love does n't sustain interest beyond the first half hour .
2,frida is n't that much different from many a hollywood romance .
2,a thinly veiled excuse for wilson to play his self deprecating act against murphy 's well honed prima donna shtick .
2,video games are more involving than this mess .
2,the movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that 's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie heads .
2,accuracy and realism are terrific but if your film becomes boring and your dialogue is n't smart then you need to use more poetic license .
2,stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle and more jokes land than crash but ultimately serving sara does n't distinguish itself from the herd .
2,the tale of tok andy lau a sleek sociopath on the trail of o takashi sorimachi the most legendary of asian hitmen is too scattershot to take hold .
2,so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft core imagery with naughty fun .
2,lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired years ago .
2,aspires to the cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like the adventures of ford fairlane .
2,sit through this one and you wo n't need a magic watch to stop time your dvd player will do it for you .
2,austin powers in goldmember is a cinematic car wreck a catastrophic collision of tastelessness and gall that nevertheless will leave fans clamoring for another ride .
2,this riveting world war ii moral suspense story deals with the shadow side of american culture racial prejudice in its ugly and diverse forms .
2,there 's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes .
2,a long winded predictable scenario .
2,if the last man were the last movie left on earth there would be a toss up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows .
2,it plods along methodically somehow under the assumption that its dead wife communicating from beyond the grave '' framework is even remotely new or interesting .
2,obviously a lot of people wasted a lot of their time including mine on something very inconsequential .
2,it all starts to smack of a hallmark hall of fame with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television .
2,they felt like the same movie to me .
2,at once half baked and overheated .
2,call me a cynic but there 's something awfully deadly about any movie with a life affirming message .
2,would that greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility .
2,you can practically smell the patchouli oil .
2,with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas but it never manages to put them on the same path .
2,this odd distant portuguese import more or less borrows from bad lieutenant and les vampires and comes up with a kind of art house gay porn film .
2,the plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset .
2,nothing about them is attractive .
2,time stands still in more ways that one in clockstoppers a sci fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable .
2,unfortunately a cast of competent performers from movies television and the theater are cast adrift in various new york city locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style .
2,at a time when we 've learned the hard way just how complex international terrorism is collateral damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture .
2,the film 's tone and pacing are off almost from the get go .
2,the end result is like cold porridge with only the odd enjoyably chewy lump .
2,adults will wish the movie were less simplistic obvious clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized .
2,this minute movie only has about minutes of decent material .
2,verbinski implements every hack artist trick to give us the ooky spookies .
2,it 's got the brawn but not the brains .
2,while not all that bad of a movie it 's nowhere near as good as the original .
2,such a fine idea for a film and such a stultifying lifeless execution .
2,it 's not as awful as some of the recent hollywood trip tripe ... but it 's far from a groundbreaking endeavor .
2,a coarse and stupid gross out .
2,static repetitive muddy and blurry hey arnold !
2,serving sara is little more than a mall movie designed to kill time .
2,plays in broad outline as pandering middle age buddy comedy .
2,shaky close ups of turkey on rolls stubbly chins liver spots red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere .
2,but no. .
2,a rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade .
2,swinging the film makes it seem is not a hobby that attracts the young and fit .
2,all that powerpuff girls charm is present in the movie but it 's spread too thin .
2,more trifle than triumph .
2,do not see this film .
2,the kid 's just too bratty for sympathy and as the film grows to its finale his little changes ring hollow .
2,too clumsy in key moments ... to make a big splash .
2,it 's only in fairy tales that princesses that are married for political reason live happily ever after .
2,could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes fatal attraction look like a classic by comparison ?
2,the soul searching deliberateness of the film although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit eventually becomes too heavy for the plot .
2,all ends well sort of but the frenzied comic moments never click .
2,sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre .
2,the characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity with the ironic exception of scooter .
2,the movie is like scorsese 's mean streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old juvenile delinquent ' paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot .
2,presents nothing special and until the final act nothing overtly disagreeable .
2,if this is an example of the type of project that robert redford 's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to then perhaps it 's time to rethink independent films .
2,officially it is twice as bestial but half as funny .
2,check your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door because you do n't want to think too much about what 's going on .
2,the film 's taste for shock humor '' will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers .
2,imagine if you will a tony hawk skating video interspliced with footage from behind enemy lines and set to jersey shore techno .
2,the movie like bartleby is something of a stiff an extra dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its minutes .
2,if you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue they still would n't add up to the time required to boil a four minute egg .
2,the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap .
2,um ... is n't that the basis for the entire plot ?
2,one lousy movie .
2,a benign but forgettable sci fi diversion .
2,zigzag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted .
2,a thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions .
2,once the downward spiral comes to pass auto focus bears out as your typical junkie opera ...
2,the colorful masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of ganesh 's rise up the social ladder .
2,although disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure it feels more forced than usual .
2,the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot but so much naturalistic small talk delivered in almost muffled exchanges eventually has a lulling effect .
2,has none of the crackle of fatal attraction '' weeks '' or even indecent proposal '' and feels more like lyne 's stolid remake of lolita '' .
2,this toothless dog already on cable loses all bite on the big screen .
2,every nanosecond of the the new guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable .
2,unless bob crane is someone of particular interest to you this film 's impressive performances and adept direction are n't likely to leave a lasting impression .
2,god help us but capra and cooper are rolling over in their graves . '
2,every dance becomes about seduction where backstabbing and betrayals are celebrated and sex is currency .

3,about a boy vividly recalls the cary grant of room for one more houseboat and father goose in its affectionate depiction of the gentle war between a reluctant irresponsible man and the kid who latches onto him .
3,reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish .
3,it 's an often cute film but either needs more substance to fill the time or some judicious editing .
3,while glover the irrepressible eccentric of river 's edge dead man and back to the future is perfect casting for the role he represents bartleby 's main overall flaw .
3,thankfully the film which skirts that rapidly deteriorating line between fantasy and reality ... takes a tongue in cheek attitude even as it pushes the croc hunter agenda .
3,red dragon makes one appreciate silence of the lambs .
3,viewed on its own terms treasure planet is better than average family entertainment but true fans of the stevenson 's novel will likely prefer disney 's more faithful live action swashbuckling classic .
3,although melodramatic and predictable this romantic comedy explores the friendship between five filipino americans and their frantic efforts to find love .
3,the setting is so cool that it chills the characters reducing our emotional stake in the outcome of intacto 's '' dangerous and seductively stylish game .
3,tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films young is cool and too young is too cool .
3,the film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future quentin tarantino picture
3,in both the writing and cutting it does not achieve the kind of dramatic unity that transports you .
3,a really funny fifteen minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature length film .
3,the movie 's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating though even if the movie itself does n't stand a ghost of a chance .
3,a solid piece of journalistic work that draws a picture of a man for whom political expedience became a deadly foreign policy .
3,to the degree that ivans xtc .
3,nair and writer laura cahill dare to build a movie around some flawed but rather unexceptional women emerging with a fine character study that 's short on plot but rich in the tiny revelations of real life .
3,immediately .
3,you come away wishing though that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that 's at the center of the story .
3,despite all the talking by the time the bloody climax arrives we still do n't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another .
3,this film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers .
3,is truth stranger than fiction ?
3,a frankenstein mishmash that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick bartleby performs neither one very well .
3,die another day is only intermittently entertaining but it 's hard not to be a sucker for its charms or perhaps it 's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with .
3,it 's a count for our times .
3,the photographer 's show don t tell stance is admirable but it can make him a problematic documentary subject .
3,the movie should be credited with remembering his victims .
3,the pinochet case is a searing album of remembrance from those who having survived suffered most .
3,at its best when the guarded resentful betty and the manipulative yet needy margot are front and center .
3,make no mistake ivans xtc .
3,the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes southern california locations and star power .
3,a stuporously solemn film .
3,directed in a flashy empty sub music video style by a director so self possessed he actually adds a period to his first name
3,the movie is a little tired maybe the original inspiration has run its course .
3,new best friend 's playboy mansion presentation of college life is laugh out loud ludicrous .
3,lends itself to the narcotizing bland sinister though not nearly so sinister as the biennial disney girl movie machinations of the biennial disney boy movie .
